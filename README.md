# When ML models improvise (without being asked to): DIG

This repository contains the code for DIG (Discrepancy Interval Generation), a tool to detect and understand where discrepancies from models that have been trained on a same dataset lie in the feature space.

An example of how to run DIG can be found in the "notebooks" folder.

Please use the "main" branch, as other branches contain work still under developpment or abandoned work.

In case of questions, do not hesitate to raise a Github issue.
